Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of ABC Company Employees and Teams
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset "Employee Working in ABC Company" aims to uncover valuable insights regarding the employees' characteristics and their corresponding roles within the company. The dataset comprises 458 rows and 9 columns, capturing a range of information about each employee. This EDA process will allow us to explore key patterns, relationships, and distributions in the dataset, which is essential for understanding employee profiles and making data-driven decisions.
The dataset includes the following 9 variables:
Name
Team
Number
Position
Age
Height
Weight
College
Salary
Through this EDA, we will investigate various aspects of the data, such as:

->Distributions of numerical variables (e.g., Age, Salary, Height, and Weight).
->Relationships and correlations between variables, particularly the impact of age and experience on salary.
->Salary trends across different teams and positions within the company.
->Anomalies or outliers in certain variables (e.g., very high or low salaries, unusual weights/heights).
->Insights into employee demographics, such as the average age or salary by team or position.
